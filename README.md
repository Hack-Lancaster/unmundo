## Project Background:

Founded on the principles of promoting dignity, community and self-sufficiency, Un Mundo is a non-profit organization dedicated to facilitating access to education, health care and livable wages in the Cangrejal watershed region of Northern Honduras.

## Project Goals:

Un Mundo is looking to enhance and improve their website in order to more efficiently communicate their mission, goals, success stories, and ways to help, donate, and volunteer.

Some of the goals they want to achieve with this redesign:
- Convey their mission very clearly to website visitors
- Leverage the website as a better fundraising tool, expanding their audience and their donations
- Enable the website to be viewed in Spanish or English
- Showcase success stories, with pictures and testimonials
- Allow the submission of comments, feedback, and questions through a contact form
- Post smaller news updates as opposed to highlighting a lengthier blog
- Add an email list signup
- Add a volunteer interest submission/signup

## Current Technology:

Un Mundo's current site, www.unmundo.org, uses Concrete5, an open source CMS written in PHP. They have fundraising/donation accounts with multiple different platforms, including: Network For Good (most prevalent), PayPal, Global Giving, Amazon Smile, and Razoo.
